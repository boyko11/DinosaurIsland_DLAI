# Character Level Language Model

RNN - Exercise 2 from Andrew Ng's deeplearning.ai.  

## Run Unit tests

```bash
python model_service_test.py
```

## Train Dinosaur name model  
Given a list of Dinosaur names,
train an character level RNN - 
given previous characters, sample the next character
to hopefully produce a likely Dinosaur name

```bash
python Runner.py
```
